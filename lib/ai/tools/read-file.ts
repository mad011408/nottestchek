If the User provides a path to a file assume that path is valid. It is okay to read a file that does not exist; an error will be returned.

Usage:
- You can optionally specify a line offset and limit (especially handy for long files), but it's recommended to read the whole file by not providing these parameters.
- Lines in the output are numbered starting at 1, using following format: LINE_NUMBER|LINE_CONTENT.
- You have the capability to call multiple tools in a single response. It is always better to speculatively read multiple files as a batch that are potentially useful.
- If you read a file that exists but has empty contents you will receive 'File is empty.'.`,
